## Project Overview

This project predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on its constituent components and age using Machine Learning. A Linear Regression model is trained on the Concrete Compressive Strength dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project includes scripts for training the model and a web application built with Streamlit for interactive predictions.

**Live Demo:** *(Add link here if you deploy it, e.g., via Streamlit Community Cloud)*

**Repository:** [http://github.com/karanji55/Compressive-Strength-Predictor](http://github.com/karanji55/Compressive-Strength-Predictor)

## Dataset

*   **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
*   **Name:** Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset
*   **Link:** [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/165/concrete+compressive+strength](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/165/concrete+compressive+strength)
*   **Description:** Contains 1030 instances with 8 quantitative input variables (features) and 1 quantitative output variable (compressive strength). The dataset file (`Concrete_Data.xls`) is downloaded automatically by the training script if not present locally.

## Features (Input Variables)

The model uses the following features (column names are cleaned during preprocessing):

1.  `Cement (component 1)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`
2.  `Blast Furnace Slag (component 2)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`
3.  `Fly Ash (component 3)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`
4.  `Water (component 4)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`
5.  `Superplasticizer (component 5)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`
6.  `Coarse Aggregate (component 6)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`
7.  `Fine Aggregate (component 7)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`
8.  `Age (day)`

## Target Variable (Output)

*   `Concrete compressive strength(MPa, megapascals)`: The final compressive strength measured in Megapascals (MPa).

## Model

*   **Type:** Linear Regression
*   **Library:** Scikit-learn (`sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`)
*   **Evaluation (on test set):**
    *   R-squared (R²): ~0.63
    *   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ~9.80 MPa

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas
*   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
*   **Model Persistence:** Joblib

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karanji55/Compressive-Strength-Predictor.git
    cd Compressive-Strength-Predictor
    ```

2.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Train the Model (Generate `concrete_strength_model.joblib`):**
    *   Run the training script from your terminal (make sure your virtual environment is active):
        ```bash
        python train_model.py
        ```
    *   This script will:
        *   Download `Concrete_Data.xls` if it doesn't exist.
        *   Load and clean the data.
        *   Train the Linear Regression model.
        *   Print evaluation metrics.
        *   Save the trained model as `concrete_strength_model.joblib`.

2.  **Run the Streamlit Prediction App:**
    *   Ensure the `concrete_strength_model.joblib` file exists (created in the previous step).
    *   Run the Streamlit app from your terminal:
        ```bash
        streamlit run app.py
        ```
    *   The application will open in your web browser, allowing you to input concrete component values and get strength predictions.
